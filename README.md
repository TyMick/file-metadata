# File metadata microservice

I created this app as a requirement for [my freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tywmick/apis-and-microservices), using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). The front end API test on the home page also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). The API fulfills the following user stories:

1.  I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
2.  The from file input field has the `name` attribute set to `"upfile"`. We rely on this in testing.
3.  When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response.
